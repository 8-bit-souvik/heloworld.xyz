A repository that includes Hello World from popular languages added by our community

# How can I add a language to the list?

1. Create a file in the `lang` folder with the name of the language you want to add (e.g.: `java.md`).
2. Add this content to your newly created file. Add your GitHub username in the `author` field. Just remove the `\` in the code backticks.

```markdown
---
lang: Java
syntax: java
title: Java is so cool!
author: devstrons
---

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
\```

# Java is so cool!
```

4. Submit a pull request with the content:

```markdown
- Added the Java language to the list.
```

5. That's it! Now you should wait until the maintainers merge your pull request.
